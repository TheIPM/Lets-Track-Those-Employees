## Description

This is Module 12 of my bootcamp, in this project using node, inquirer and MYSQL I have developed an employee tracker. This application allows a user to not only view employees, view departments and view roles in a company but also add roles, departments and employees to an existing database using inquirer.

## Usage

In order to use this application, you need to run an npm install to install the correct dependenceies. Once they are installed you can then open the integrated terminal and type "node server.js" which will initialize inquirer and will generate prompts which then a user can just follow to see what they want to see, Here are a few screenshots showing the application in progress:
